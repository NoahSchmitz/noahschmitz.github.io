## Nook Simple Touch

I'm going to keep this one kinda brief, their is already a lot of specific information on this topic elsewhere.

### Back Story (Feel Free to Skip)

I have owned two Nook Simple Touchs (NST) in the past several years. The first one died of natural causes (Read: Negligence) and I could never justify getting another one until I needed to spend some BestBuy Giftcards. What else are you going to get for 50$ at BestBuy? A _very small_ TV? 

### Why The NST is Cool
The NST is pretty average as far as E-Readers go. In a lot of respects it is inferior to other big name E-Readers like the Kindle. However, it has a touchscreen instead of buttons and that opens some interesting doors. How you ask? Well, underneath all that Barnes and Noble crap, lies a beautiful install of Android 2.1 Ã‰clair. Okay, fine, maybe that is a little out of date, but you can still do all sorts of fun stuff!

Essentially, after [rooting](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2040351) and installing [Google Apps](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2086582) you are left with a relatively capable E-Ink Tablet. A tablet with extremely long battery life, that can be read in direct sunlight, with no eye-strain, and that cost you less than a meal at a fancy restaurant.

Obviously you are never really going to play Angry Birds on it (Although you [can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBbl6egyPsQ) if you _really_ want to). But it is great for catching up on your RSS feeds or checking your email on the beach. ALso I suppose it goes without saying that it is an **amazing** E-Reader. There are a lot of E-Book apps you can try,  [Aldiko](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aldiko.android), [Cool Reader](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.coolreader), and with a little work, [Google Play Books](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1732611).

### Any Questions?
If anyone out there stumbled across this looking for a more detailed guide, I left a _**lot**_ out. Shoot me an [email](http://mailto:noah@noahschmitz.info) or leave a comment and I can give you a lot more tips, or even do a little write-up of the whole process. However as always, [Google is your friend](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Nook+Simple+Touch+XDA+Developers), and there is already a lot out there.
