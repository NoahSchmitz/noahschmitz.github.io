## Good thing I got the Leatherworking Merit Badge!
####Except not, becuase that taught me nothing other than how to use stamps...

I have worn leather belts before. I have also wrapped strips of leather around handles to make them look cooler. None of this really prepared me for my latest project.

##Epic BackStory Time!

Recently I read this:

[The Manly Tradition of the Pocket Notebook](artofmanliness.com/2010/08/23/the-manly-tradition-of-the-pocket-notebook/ "Super Manly") (love that site, go check it out)

Normally I would be kinda, meh. However, in a few short months I will be setting out for the strange land of Pirricicaba, Brazil. While there on my LDS Mission, I will no longer be able to carry a phone, tablet, and e-reader at all times. So I decided now would be a good time to become aquanted with the ancient art of "paper"

I bought a bunch of [Black Field Notes](http://fieldnotesbrand.com/shop/pitchblack/ "Black Goes With Everything"), and I think they fit the bill. However, I know my back pocket will destroy them (if my wallet is anything to go by).
