## Good thing I got the Leatherworking Merit Badge!
####Except not, becuase that taught me nothing other than how to use stamps...

I have worn leather belts before. I have also wrapped strips of leather around handles to make them look cooler. None of this really prepared me for my latest project.

##Epic BackStory Time!

Recently I read this article on TheArtofManliness:

[The Manly Tradition of the Pocket Notebook](artofmanliness.com/2010/08/23/the-manly-tradition-of-the-pocket-notebook/ "Super Manly") (love that site, go check it out)

Normally I would be kinda, meh. However, in a few short months I will be setting out for the strange land of [Piracicaba, Brazil](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Piracicaba+-+SP,+Brazil/@-22.7249629,-47.6475382,3a,75y,17.1h,74.98t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sncsK1mSHo-kOAeoMWKuPuQ!2e0!4m2!3m1!1s0x94c631c14f4c9d3b:0x270ec30013dc341c!6m1!1e1 "Random Street!"). While there on my LDS Mission, I will no longer be able to carry a phone, tablet, and e-reader at all times. So I decided now would be a good time to become aquanted with the ancient art of "paper"

I bought a bunch of [Black Field Notes](http://fieldnotesbrand.com/shop/pitchblack/ "Black Goes With Everything"), and I think they fit the bill. However, I know my back pocket will destroy them (if my wallet is anything to go by).

##An Answer Presents Itself

Originally I was thingking of something like [this](saddlebackleather.com/moleskinecover "Saddleback Leather!")

![Super Expensive Leather Cover!](/http://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/saddleback-notebook-cover-1.jpg)

And that would be awesome. Just one problem, I bought Field Notes, Not a [Moleskine](http://moleskine.com/us/collections/model/product/squared-soft-notebook-pocket "Fancy Notebooks!") So I wouldnt be able to use the cool elastic thing.
