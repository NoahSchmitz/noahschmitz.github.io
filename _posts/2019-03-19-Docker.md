## How Does Docker?

Welcome back faithful readers! Been a spell, but I wanted to post *something* on here. If for nothing else as an exercise to see if I can write this post from Eclipse. If your reading this, I have succeeded. Anywho, on to todays topic! Docker!

Now I shouldn't be giving explanations, becuase I rarely seem to know what I'm doing. But in a nutshell (weird phrase right?) Docker is a way of deploying "containers" which, as I understand it, are little stripped down VM's. The nice part about this is you can install, uninstall, and modify software on your machine, without actually effecting the base setup, and with less overhead than a full VM.

## Get To the Good Stuff Already!

Okay fine! I'm using Docker mainly for my plex server, and my setup is largely based upon this guide.
