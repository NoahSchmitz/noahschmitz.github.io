## A Problem Appears. (Skipable Back Story Time!)

As some of my readers (all 3 of you) may know, soon I will embark on a religious mission to Brazil [for my church](http://lds.org). One of the rules of such a mission is that I have to listen to my music over a speaker (not personal earbuds/headophones). Seeing as I am not to keen to ship a stereo to brazil I needed a small mp3 player with a good speaker. 

## One Speaker to Rule Them All
######(One Speaker to Find Them, One Speaker to Bring Them All, and in the Darkness Bind Them)

Anyway, [This](http://www.satechi.net/index.php/satechi-sd-mini-portable-pocket-speaker-mp3-player-sd-card-reader-for-iphone-5s-5c-5-4-ipod-touch-4g-sandisk-sansa-clip-plus-blackberry-htc-evo-droid-samsung-wave-samsung-galaxy-s2-s3-s4 "Long URL is Long") is the speaker I settled on. ([Amazon Prime Eligbile!](http://www.amazon.com/Satechi-Portable-Speaker-SanDisk-BlackBerry/dp/B0043WDNRI "Loves Me Some Amazon"))

Now I know what your thinking, "What is this?" "A Freaken Product Review?" That is exactly what this is. No, I'm not working for Satechi (in fact I had never heard of them before this week) I'm simply a very satisfied customer.

##Why is it Awesome Exactly?

Good Question Title! First and foremost, The speaker is freaken amazing. Most cell phones/MP# players, even high end ones, have on tiny little crappy speaker. This thing is all about the speaker!

###Speaker

Definetly the biggest selling point. I'm not an "[audiophille](reddit.com/r/audiophile "What? I dabble."), but I enjoy being able to hear at least highs, mids, and lows, not just one tinny monstrosity. 

The cool little pop up part really does a decent job acting as a "subwoofer" obviously we are talking about something that fits in my palm, but for the size, it's hard to beat.

On top is the main speaker and it sounds awesome. Not home theater level awesome, but way better than any "mobile speaker I have ever heard.

Final speaker comment, this thing could be described as "Omnidirectional" meaning I can put this liitle thing in the middle of a room and everyone can listen, not just the people on one side. The speaker can be loud enough to fill a large room, or quiet enough for just you.

###Buttons!

There are only two buttons on the entire unit. This odd little rocker dial thingy:

and a Mute/Mode button.
