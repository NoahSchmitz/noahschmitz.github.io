title: Adventures in Fire (part 2)
---

Since my last attempt to smelt aluminum, I have done a little more preparation. New crucible, actual plan for carrying hot crucibles, and my first attempt at making actual casts instead of buckets of sand. Unfortunately, I still have a cell phone as my camera, I'll fix that by the next update.

### Time to Turn Up the Heat
(Note: If you do this at night- be careful)

If you are anything like me, you can't really justify spending lots of money on a [silicon carbide crucible](https://www.google.com/search?q=silicon+carbide&rlz=1C1SAVS_enUS535US535&oq=silicon+carbide&aqs=chrome..69i57&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=0&ie=UTF-8#q=silicon+carbide+crucible&tbm=shop) I would recommend a thick bottomed steel pot from your local thrift store/garage sale. Putting a bolt in each side and buying some cheap tongs to hook those with is easy, cheap, and safe.

###Sand Casting Attempt //#2

My sand cast turned out much better this time. I buried a cube of foam (Hey- I'm lazy) and dumped my molten Aluminum down the shaft I made

I did not have enough molten to cast the entire cube, but it is a pretty good ingot nonetheless.

### Fancy Plaster Molds!

I also _attempted_ to make a plaster mold following [this method](http://www.instructables.com/id/Make-a-two-part-reusable-mold-using-plaster/) Which turned out to be pretty hard/messy in the dark.

The general idea is to encase one half in soap covered (To stop sticking) Play-Doh

and to pour plaster-of-paris on top to create the first half of the mold.

![GOO!](http://www.drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=0B6bvHkeOaSe-anFCaEkyczduTEhOV3g1Nkp1VzlHRGtCc3Y0)

Once that has set, peal the Play-Doh off the bottom, and coat that in soap.

Pour plaster on that, and Voila! Two part cast. I need to work on refining this process (preferably somewhere with good lighting) before I actually have a decent mold.
