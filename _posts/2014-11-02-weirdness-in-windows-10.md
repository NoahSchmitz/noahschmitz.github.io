title: Weirdness in Windows 10
---

## This Is Why We Use Linux.

Recently for kicks and giggles I installed Windows 10. I was pleasantly surprised with a much more dektop oriented system (compared to 8) and a few nice features Windows has been lacking (like multiple desktops).

However, since the product was made by microsoft, there is some weirdness. When you open file explorer it is upposed to take you to the "Home" screen which looks something like this:

But for some reason mine looks like this after the latest update:

I dont _think_ I did anything to break it, but broke it is. After messing around in the registery trying to get something (or anything) to show up in my home, I gave up. I never use the "Home" anyway. However it was really annoying having it default to something useless.

##This Is Where Things Get Complicated

So I set out to have it default to "This PC" which is slightly more usefull than my empty "Home"

###NOTE: DO NOT do anything I do past this point if you are worried about messing with thinhgs that shouldnt be messed with. That being said, Windows 10 is in beta anyway, so lets mess with stuff!

I typically launch Explorer from the Start Bar (not to be confused with the screen or Menu) It is always visible, and very convienient. So _technically_ I should just be able to change the shortcut on my bar right?

Nope.

For some unfathomable reason, Microsoft has made the box I need unclickable
