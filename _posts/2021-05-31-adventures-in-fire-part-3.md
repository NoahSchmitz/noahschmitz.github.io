## Back after a long Hiatus

The Last time I tried anything with metal casting was back in 2014, when I was a senior in highschool. Now, 7 years later, I have signifigantly more common sense, and perhaps even more importantly, Money.

With my newfound funding, curtesy of a soul sucking job, I purchased this [kiln](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07H43Q81K/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B07H43Q81K&linkCode=as2&tag=tk4210b-20&linkId=dbe018d906b437b36624f86786af3367/) to do PLA burnouts.

My methodollogy for casting now that I have a very reliable/consistent heat source is essentially the following:

1.3D print an object
2.Make a plaster mold around the 3D print
3.Dry and burnout mold in the kiln
4.Melt metal
5.Pour molten metal into mold
6.Break off plaster mold

I'm not going to talk about 3D prints here, that's a whole nother ballgame. I frequently use my schools or father's printer, becuase keeping printers running and clog free is a pain.

Unfortunantly I don't have any pictures of this step, but I do have some thoughts on this process. Simply mixing plaster of paris and water seems to work well, although I see some people recomend including sand.

The main issues I have had are making the mold edges so thick, that it's difficult to heat the inside enough to burn out the mold. Making the edges on the thinner side, seems to help quite a bit. I generally use paper or foam cups, but antything you can easily peel off plaster should work fine.

In my first attempts, I figured at high enough tempuratures the PLA would essentially vaporize, however I had much better success putting the mold suspended upside down over a catch tray, and letting the PLA melt out, before mostly burning off.

The company that manufactures the kiln I purchased sell other products like [this](https://www.amazon.com/Tabletop-QuikMelt-PRO-120-Melting-Furnace/dp/B07888X23W/ref=sr_1_33?dchild=1&keywords=PMC+Supplies+LLC&qid=1622521920&sr=8-33)
