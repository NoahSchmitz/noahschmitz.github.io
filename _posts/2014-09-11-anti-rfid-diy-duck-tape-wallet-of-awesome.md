## The only wallet you will ever need.

I have never been happy with store-bought wallets. Why? Maybe it's becuase I'm way to hipster to be using some mainstream bilfold. Maybe it's that I don't like the idea of **paying** for something, that is supposed to hold money. What it really boils down to, is that I take pockets very seriously, and I know exactly which ones I want.

##There is a Better Way.

Enter the Duck Tape Wallet. Exactly what you want, nothing that you don't. Personally this is my list

- Bi-fold style
- Clear ID pocket
- 2-3 Card holders
- RFID Blocking

Your needs/wants may vary. But with a little creativity you should be able to accomodate whatever configuration your little heart desires.

##BLah, Blah, Blah. Show me How Already!

Okay fine! for starters, you will need to go grab your roll of duck tape (what do you mean you don't have any? Disgrace.)

You are going to begin by deciding the dimensions of your wallet. Mine is roughly 4"X 3", but pick a size you like. Take both dimensions and double them. Using strips of tape, make a sheet roughly 8"X6" (or to whatever dimensions you picked)
