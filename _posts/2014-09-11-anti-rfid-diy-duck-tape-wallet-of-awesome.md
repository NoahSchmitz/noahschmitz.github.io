## The only wallet you will ever need.

I have never been happy with store-bought wallets. Why? Maybe it's becuase I'm way to hipster to be using some mainstream bilfold. Maybe it's that I don't like the idea of **paying** for something, that is supposed to hold money. What it really boils down to, is that I take pockets very seriously, and I know exactly which ones I want.

##There is a Better Way.

Enter the Duck Tape Wallet. Exactly what you want, nothing that you don't. Personally this is my list

- Bi-fold style
- Clear ID pocket
- 2-3 Card holders
- RFID Blocking
