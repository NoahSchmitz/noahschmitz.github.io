## You Can Tell a Lot about a Man by What He Carries in His Pockets

First let me start by saying that the internet needs more EDC sites/posts about as much as it needs more food blogs and cat pictures. That being said, I am much more interested in this than cats or food, so I will anyway.

EDC is an interwebs acronym standing for Every Day Carry. If you didn't know that you are about to get either:

A) Very Bored
B) Very Excited

If you are in catogory A, leave. (we don't serve your kind!) If you are more of a catagory B kind of guy (or girl) then you should probably check these out **after** reading my super exciting blog post.

## Epic Backstory (Skip/Skim at Your Leisure)

As a kid, I was always galavanting around my huge backyard with my siblings. We had many adventures, we had epic duels, built a treehouse, and founded a small nation in a tree (amoung other things). To be prepared for whatever I might find myself needing out in the woods, I carried a lot of stuff when we played. No one wanted to go back to the house simply becuase you needed a rubber band or a bit of twine.

Knowing this, my awesome parents bought me a utility belt. Seriously. Like the one batman has. I remember it vividly (although I can't find it on the interwebs). It was National Geographic brand, and had all kinds of pouches and loops to hold all my gadgets and bits. This gift started a lifelong trend of awesomeness.

Since then I have changed what I carry a lot. The kids utility belt is far to small these days, and my needs (and budget) have changed alot from when I was eight.

## My Pocket Loadout

I had never heard the phrase "EDC" until I started reaserching purchases on the internet (then I saw it everywhere). I always referred to my EDC as my "Pocket Loadout" Loadout meaning ["(originally military) The set of objects to be carried into battle; all that one needs for a specific purpose"](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/loadout) (yay wiktionary!) It seemed a fitting phrase (and way more romantic than "EDC", right?)

##Shut up and Tell Me What You Carry Dude!

I never stopped loving that utility belt, but my waistline has gotten bigger. Enter the [Grab-it-Pack-it Holster](thinkgeek.com/product/c616/) I bought mine off Thinkgeek, because a) Thinkgeek is cool, b) It's cheaper there.

I freaken love this thing. It can hold all the things. It fits my (cheapo) 7" tablet like it was made for it. Also, that tablet pocket (on the deluxe) is big enough to comfortably fit my tablet and my Nook Simple Touch, which is always nice to have for reading on the go.

The smaller pocket fits most smartphones, and (more importantly) an Altoids Tin! I normally carry my phone in another pocket anyway. So in that pocket I carry my Altoids Tin, which as some of my readers may have guessed, does not contain Altoids. (More on my fancy Altoids tin in another post)![IMAG0149.jpg](/media/IMAG0149.jpg)
