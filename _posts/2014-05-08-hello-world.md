Hai! This is a post. I hope.

Well, we are off to a decent start here. This is so much more elegant than my Wordpress Blog! Quick shout out to my good friend [Adam](http://blog.adamhovorka.com) for helping me set this up. I have always been bad at journaling and worse at blogging, but I will give it another shot. For posterity. 

I will be shooting for at least one post a week, if I can find anything blog worthy in my mundane life. No promises on the actual regularity, but that is the goal. 

So if your reading this, and you aren't a family member, staring over my shoulder, or Adam; shoot me an e-mail, and let me know what you think about my humble blog [noah@noahschmitz.info](mailto:noah@noahschmitz.info)
