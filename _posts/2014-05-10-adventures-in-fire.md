## Aluminum Foundry Mark 1

For quite some time I have wanted an Aluminum foundry. I am limited by time and resources, but after spending many hours on [backyardmetalcasting](http://www.backyardmetalcasting.com/) and random instructibles, I produced my very own ghettofabulous foundry.

###Tips
If you too feel a _burning_ desire to melt and cast stuff out of aluminum you may want to keep reading.

- Technically you should line your bucket with [refractory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractory) to make it last longer. I'm too cheap/lazy.
- Hair driers with the "cool" button taped down make for a cheap and easy bellows/air source but melt a little if your connecting pipe is too short (like mine).
- Soup cans are not a good canidate for crucibles. The internet said I could get away with it, if I only used it once, but the bottom corroded and formed a hole. Buy/make a real crucible.

In conclusion, this is honestly pretty cheap and easy. A bucket, a (metal) pipe, and a hairdrier, is all you need for the main foundry. Scrounge up some charcoal and a crucible and you are good to go!

Oh and of course--be safe. I would recomend:

- Welding gloves 
- Cool Goggles
- Tongs
